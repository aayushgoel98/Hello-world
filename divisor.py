#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
#(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
#For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

n= int(input("Please enter the number for a divior"))
i=1
while i<=n:
	if (n % i==0) :
		print("",i)
